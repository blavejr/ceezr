Hey guys I am extremely tired but I tried to do as much as I could.

The BE and FE will run on local host, default ports. but the DB is on mongo atlas, I couldnt get the local container to connect.

I will hopefully come back and update this readme.

I also pushed to master by mistake, so I will just create a PR into main

I had to move fast to get as much as I could done within the 4 hours plus its my first attempt at Nestjs.

The Nestjs docs are interesting, alot of boilerplate but I can see why this is a loved framework.

I tried to use as much nest stuff as I could following the docs, swagger

- http://localhost:3000/api Swagger docs
- http://localhost:3001/ FE
- http://localhost:3000/ BE

Run the BE first so react doesnt take that 3000 port

I tried to use nest/passport basic strategy, everything is hardcoded so it should be simple to authenticate

If anything I hope you enjoy playing the little game this turned into.

Happy hacking :)
